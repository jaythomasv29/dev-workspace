# This is my first ruby program
# p prints data to the screen with a new line but also gives information on type of data was printed:
p "Hello" # prints and also gets the type
p 92

# print does not add a new line
print "Hi my name is James" + "\n"

# puts (put string) adds a new line everytime

puts "Hello World"
puts "Goodbye"

# Numbers
puts 1 + 1 # Add
puts 1 - 1 # Subtract
puts 9.0 / 2 # Divide - If you want a decimal, you need at least a decial number
puts 2 * 2 # Multiply
puts 3 % 2 # Modulo

num_1 = 3
num_2 = 4
puts num_2 > num_1
puts 99 == 99.0

puts 92
p 92
